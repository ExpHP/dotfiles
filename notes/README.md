# Notes

Hm. This seems out of place here.

Well, this is a collection of personal documentation on my computer setup
and/or solutions to recurring problems I've encountered on the
following computers:

* A ThinkPad T430, bought from my institution.
* A hand-built gaming PC used from 2012 to as recent as march 2017.
  Initial specs were an AMD FX-8120 and a SAPPHIRE Radeon HD 7970;
  after beginning to show its age, the GPU got replaced with a
  ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1070 AMP! Edition.
* A ThinkPad T430s to replace the old beast in bullet #1.

Though it largely just assilimates instructions and tips from online sources,
the point is that by having all of this information in one place, it may
greatly reduce the time it takes me to get back up to speed on a new OS.

The vast majority of it is unlikely to be useful to anyone,
but you are free to browse nonetheless.

(note: it may make references to files that do not exist on github,
as I was not comfortable with just throwing the whole notes directory online,
which contains various downloaded files that I don't feel like scrubbing for
possible licensing issues)
