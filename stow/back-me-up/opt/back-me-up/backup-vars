# mount point for backup drive
# mounting the drive here should make /etc/rsnapshot.conf's snapshot_root
#  become "available".  As in, it should only be possible to place files
#  in `snapshot_root` when the drive is mounted.
#
# To accomplish this, you have a couple of options:
# (a) let `snapshot_root` be a SUBDIRECTORY of this mount point, and set
#     `no_create_root	1` in `/etc/rsnapshot.conf`, OR:
# (b) let `snapshot_root` be the mount point itself, and make it immutable;
#     `chattr +i /my/epic/mount/point`
MOUNT=/mnt/ext4-backup

# UUID of backup drive
# The files in `/dev/disk/by-uuid` are symlinks, so just do `ls -l` and find
#   the link to the right partition

# Trigger files
# You must set up something that creates these files periodically (they can be
#  empty). I suggest anacron jobs.
# When present, backup-and-rotate will do a rotation and delete the trigger file.
