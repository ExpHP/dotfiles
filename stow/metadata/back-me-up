Install my personal backup system.

This is the whole shebang.  The script, its own config and its
meager documentation are all dumped into /opt.
Config for other programs (e.g. cron jobs and rsnapshot.conf)
are also included.

You should install anacron and rsnapshot as well.
On arch, this is the cronie package, and after installing it you
should do:

    sudo systemctl enable --now cronie.service

This will require root.
